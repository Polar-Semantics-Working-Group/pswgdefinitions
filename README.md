# Polar Semantics Working Group terminology

## Background
This purpose of this repository is to establish definitions of concepts that are frequently used in the polar community. 
The intention is to ensure that a common terminology is used across communities and that this simplifies internal communication. 
It is not duplicating efforts elsewhere and the information is provided in a form which allows integration into semantic tools.

Concepts to be added are raised as issues and discussion and decisions on the concepts and their definition are done through issues and the formal working group meetings.
